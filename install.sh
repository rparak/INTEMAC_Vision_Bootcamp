# Conda Environment Setup Script
# ==============================
# Author: Roman Parak
# ==============================
# To use the installation script, it is necessary to run the following commands:
#   1. Open the terminal.
#   2. Navigate to the folder containing install.sh.
#   3. Make the script executable by typing:
#      user_name@hostname:~$ chmod +x install.sh
#   4. Run the script by typing:
#      user_name@hostname:~$ ./install.sh
#
# Description:
#  The script installs Miniconda (if necessary), sets up a Conda environment,
#  installs necessary Python packages, and verifies the installation.
