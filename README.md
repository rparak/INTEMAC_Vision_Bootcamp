## Vision Bootcamp - Day 2: Object Detection Using AI Techniques

The second day of the **Vision Bootcamp** delves into modern approaches to **object detection** using **artificial intelligence (AI)** techniques. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be applied to specific machine vision tasks. Practical examples will demonstrate how these technologies enable efficient and accurate object detection in real-world scenarios.
