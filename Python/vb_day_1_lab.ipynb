    "### Description of the Practical App.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this practical application is to integrate an object detection method into a specific part of the code to detect objects in images captured by the Basler camera, either by connecting to a live camera or by loading an image from a file. Using object detection techniques, we will identify and highlight the INTEMAC logo in the captured image through approaches such as contour detection, shape analysis, or template matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are encouraged to choose the object detection technique based on the prior demonstration and their own knowledge."

    "## Importing Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first step, we import the necessary libraries that will be used throughout this practical app.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: This is the main library weâ€™ll use for image processing tasks, such as reading, displaying, and manipulating images.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib (`plt`)**: We use this library for plotting images and displaying results inside the notebook.\n",
    "- **NumPy (`np`)**: NumPy is a powerful library that helps with numerical operations, including matrix and array manipulations, which are essential in computer vision tasks.\n",
    "- **OS (`os`)**: This helps with file and directory operations, allowing us to load and save images from specific locations on your computer.\n",
    "- **Utilities.Camera (`Basler_Cls`)**: The `Basler_Cls` class is designed to interface with Basler cameras using the `pypylon` library. It allows us to configure the camera, capture images, and release resources when done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation for a smooth OpenCV workflow, and with these tools, we can start manipulating images in an interactive and fun way!"
